## My Prompt
Now, what part in my read me are lacking clarity? https://github.com/LWFlouisa/Reconstructive-Neurosymbolic

## Phind Suggested
Based on the provided context, there are a few areas in your README that could benefit from clearer explanations:

1. **Standard Theory**: It would be helpful to provide more context about the data samples and their relationship to the problem you're trying to solve. Additionally, you could clarify the objective of finding the least good outcome that isn't the worst.

2. **Including Longterm Memory**: The concept of remembered fortunes could be better explained by providing a concrete example of how it works in the context of neurosymbolic computing. You could also discuss how this concept is applied to create two competing neurosymbolic subroutines.

3. **Combined Implementation**: The implementation process could be more clearly explained by breaking it down into smaller steps. For example:
   - Create two nodes for neuro symbolic thinking.
   - Shuffle different neutral outcomes using Vortex based math in each node.
   - If two neutral outcomes match, retain matching outcome in long-term memory.
   - Reconstruct the poem and reorder based on implied logic.

4. **Usage In Generative AI**: Provide a more detailed explanation of how this approach differs from traditional sampling in poetry generators, and the benefits of using the Reconstructive-Neurosymbolic method.

By addressing these points, your README would provide a clearer understanding of the Reconstructive-Neurosymbolic approach and its applications.
